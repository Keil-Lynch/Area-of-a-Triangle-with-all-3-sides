Three sides of a triangle are taken in the program, and the total surface area of the triangle is calculated.

Area of a Triangle with all 3 sides

An area of a triangle given its three sides can be calculated using the Python programming language.

Problem Description

Three sides of a triangle are taken in the program, and the total surface area of the triangle is calculated.

Problem Solution

1. All three sides of the triangle should be stored separately in three variables.
2. Calculate the triangle's area by using the Heron's formula.
3. Identify the area of the triangle.
4. Proceed to exit.

Program Explanation

1. Each number must be entered separately and stored in a separate variable.
2. In order to find s, it is necessary to find that it equals (a+b+c)/2
3. Next, the area of all three sides of the triangle is calculated with Heron's formula.
4. This is followed by printing the area of the triangle.
